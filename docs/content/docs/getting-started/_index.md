## Prerequisites

AudioBookRequest has been packaged as a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) image
to make it easy to deploy and run on servers. While it is possible to run ABR
without Docker, that option should be avoided if possible and only used for
local development, as a lot of things can change from version to version.

## Setup

Head to [Running the app](./running-the-app) for instructions on how to run ABR.
