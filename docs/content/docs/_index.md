## What is it?

AudioBookRequest is a tool that can be used in combination with media servers
like plex/audiobookserver/jellyfin/etc. to easily set up a pipeline for creating
a wishlist of audiobooks you want to listen to.

## Why do I want it?

Help your user know if your project will help them. Useful information can
include:

- **What is it good for?**: If you have multiple people using your ABS instance
  and you don't want them to always have to message you for new books or you
  don't want to give them access to something like Readarr/Prowlarr, you can use
  AudioBookRequest to allow them to easily request any books they want to listen
  to and have it notify and/or automatically start any required downloads.

- **What is it not good for?**: AudioBookRequest is **not** a full replacement
  for Readarr, nor is that the plan. Readarr does a lot of things, but it is
  also currently in a very messy state development-wise. ABR does not currently
  keep track of your library, while automatically downloading new releases and
  trying to upgrade the quality of already existing audiobooks. These are
  features that are less relevant with audiobooks.

- **What is it _not yet_ good for?**: AudioBookRequest is currently unable to
  move any downloads, add metadata to files, or rename files according to some
  structure.
